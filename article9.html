          ‘It’s been a topsy-turvy kind of campaign for us’
        </h1>
          <p class="article-info">
          By Derrick Lynch
        </p>  
          <div class="article-content">
<p>It is shaping up to be busy 2019 for Fergal Lynch. The 2013 All-Ireland winner is not just juggling his job as principal of Quin National School with managing the Clare minor hurlers but he is also planning to take up arms once more for Clooney-Quin, as the club season rolls around.</p>
<p>It’s a role he is enjoying. “Managing your county is something you would always love to be able to do, no matter what the level. I was involved with the Clare U-14s back in 2008 and I really enjoyed it. I chose to focus on my own hurling career at that point and when I made the decision to retire from playing inter-county myself, I got involved as part of Davy Fitzgerald’s backroom team for a few years, so when this opportunity came about I said I would go for it and so far we have been going well. We started at the end of October and we have over 50 sessions done, along with a good few challenge games. We are only nine weeks out from championship now, so the fine-tuning is going to be done from here on out and that will be very important for lads at that age,” he noted.</p>
<p>This will be the second year of the minor grade at inter-county being capped at U-17 and Lynch feels it is something that has affected the type of player coming through at that level.</p>
<p>“You would have to question the reason for changing it. I know it was to try and reduce the impact in terms of the Leaving Cert but, at the moment, we are working with lads who are doing their Junior Cert, which is equally as important. You can see that lads are a lot weaker physically and have a lot of developing to do in that regard. They’re a really infectious bunch and are really willing to learn and they are open to trying out new things and new styles of play, so that has been very enjoyable so far. </p>
<p>“Minor hurling is always seen as this free-flowing type of game and it is always a great curtain-raiser to the senior finals down through the years. It’s great to see the games being played before the senior provincial games now too. There’s not as much emphasis on the tactical side of things but that has started to creep in a little bit. I thought it was noticeable last year in the Limerick game, in that they were very much trying to play a similar style of game to the seniors.</p>
<p>Clare now have seven weeks to correct this issue and no doubt they will work hard to ensure they are in similar form to last year, when they went on a run that saw them be the width of a post away from an All-Ireland final.</p> 
<p>“We have a few from that panel still involved, with the likes of Cian Galvin, Tony Butler, Shane Meehan and Connor Hegarty, who all played last year, and they are great leaders. Cian is our captain and Tony is vice-captain, along with Diarmuid Cahill, so they know what championship is about and they know what to expect come May 12,” said Lynch.</p>
<p>Despite the championship game being on the horizon, Lynch is confident that both sides will be holding nothing back once the whistle blows on Saturday afternoon. “It would be their first bit of silverware in a while if they managed to win the league and a semi-final against Galway or Wexford would be a great carrot to look forward to also. The league is a fantastic competition and you can see that players thrive on it and it’s a great way to blood players.”</p>

           Whenever the word Clonbony is mentioned, the chances are Tom Malone will be too. 2018 marked a decade since the former president of Clare GAA passed away, after a lifetime dedicated to his beloved club. The legacy the great man left behind is as strong as ever and this Saturday night will see Clonbony Gaels from the last 50 years and beyond gather to reminisce on their time involved with the club.
           Founded in 1936, Clonbony has served as an outlet for the people of Miltown and its environs to participate in Gaelic games, along with being a social outlet too.
            Camogie, ladies football, the Clonbony pipe band and athletics club all fell under the club banner, as Tom developed his dream.
