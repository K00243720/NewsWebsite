          Seven weeks to iron out issues
        </h1>
          <p class="article-info">
          By Eoghan Moloney
        </p>  
          <div class="article-content">
<p>As the curtains draws on Clare’s National Hurling League campaign, Clare will reflect on a mediocre campaign but one that also yielded some positives.</p>
<p>Clare appear to have added a new star to their ranks in the form of Diarmuid Ryan. Every game he started in, barring the Tipperary game, he showed up quite well and stated his case that he should be considered for a starting jersey come championship.</p>
<p>With David Reidy not featuring in the league, it could have paved the way for the Cratloe man to make his mark at half-forward for Clare. Pace, power, accuracy and composure – Ryan appears to have the required skill set to flourish in championship hurling but also has the size that Clare need in their forward ranks. He offers an option for Donal Tuohy when going long with puck-outs and gets up and down the wing as a half-forward in the modern game should. He has been Clare’s greatest find this league campaign.</p>
<p>What has not been Clare’s greatest find is the recent run of indiscipline throughout the league. While it is a widely held belief that referees are more lenient in championship games, it must be concerning that Clare are regularly allowing teams that they have in serious trouble in open play, back into games through continuous fouling. Or worse, as was the case in the Cork game, throw away a winning position due to indiscipline.</p>
<p>While Waterford had Clare in all kinds of trouble all over the pitch last weekend, it is also telling that Stephen Bennett scored 14 frees. That’s three free-takers in Bennett, Pat Horgan and Kevin Kelly taking in hauls of 14 points or more from placed balls against Clare this league campaign.
If this statistic does not correct itself by championship, Clare will find themselves struggling to qualify from Munster this year. You simply cannot afford teams in such a savagely competitive division regular opportunities to punish you on the scoreboard - because they will.
</p>
<p>Clare now have seven weeks to correct this issue and no doubt they will work hard to ensure they are in similar form to last year, when they went on a run that saw them be the width of a post away from an All-Ireland final.</p> 
<p>There is no doubt that when Clare do fire, they’re a formidable challenge to any team in the country and there have been glimpses of that form this year in the league to suggest when it comes to crunch time in May and June, that this squad are capable of succeeding.</p>
<p>The main worry is the inconsistency that has been a factor in the last year or so. The hot spells, followed by cold ones - evident in the Munster final, both games against Galway and in many other games in the last 12 months. If this team want to jump to the next level, they have do one thing; become dependable.</p>

           Whenever the word Clonbony is mentioned, the chances are Tom Malone will be too. 2018 marked a decade since the former president of Clare GAA passed away, after a lifetime dedicated to his beloved club. The legacy the great man left behind is as strong as ever and this Saturday night will see Clonbony Gaels from the last 50 years and beyond gather to reminisce on their time involved with the club.
           Founded in 1936, Clonbony has served as an outlet for the people of Miltown and its environs to participate in Gaelic games, along with being a social outlet too.
            Camogie, ladies football, the Clonbony pipe band and athletics club all fell under the club banner, as Tom developed his dream.
