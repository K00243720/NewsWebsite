          McConville predicts ‘titanic battle’ in Newry
        </h1>
          <p class="article-info">

          <div class="article-content">
<p>Two crucial league points are on offer when Clare make the trip to Newry this Sunday to face Armagh in the second game of their National Football League Division 2 campaign. The Banner make the trip over the border after an encouraging performance against Donegal last weekend, while the Orchard men left Newbridge with a share of the spoils against Kildare.</p>
<p>The venue for the game has created plenty of talking points, with Armagh being forced to give up home advantage in the Athletic Grounds after breaching a training ban. Former All-Ireland winner with the Ulster men Oisín McConville feels they will be aggrieved at how the sanction was imposed.</p>
<p>“The thing about Armagh is that they do tend to play really well in the Athletic Grounds. They’re comfortable there in their own surroundings but, at the same time, Newry isn’t particularly out of the way. The reason why Armagh are so annoyed about it is because the same punishment hasn’t been doled out to other teams; at least that’s the sense I am getting from them. Having it in Newry isn’t a major disadvantage, though. A lot of the Armagh players would have experience of playing there, whether at colleges or club level, so it shouldn’t hold any major fear for Armagh,” he said.</p>
<p>The last time these sides met was in the All-Ireland qualifiers last year, when a late rally from Kieran McGeeney’s outfit saw them end Clare’s championship season. McConville feels that while they will be braced for a Banner backlash, Armagh have some scores to settle too.</p>
<p>He said, “The strange thing about this weekend is that you have two sides who will feel they are in the wounded animal role. Clare will want revenge for last year’s qualifier defeat but Armagh are sick to not have brought both points away from Newbridge against Kildare. I think that means that both teams will come into this game feeling they have something of a point to prove and both will have grievances about their opening league games, so I think it will be a titanic battle.”</p>
<p>Sunday will be the first of four games on the road for Clare, with trips to Enniskillen, Newbridge and Thurles also on the horizon in the coming weeks. McConville feels the fact that Armagh have already gotten a point on the board from one of their away trips means there is added pressure on the Banner to get off the mark this weekend.</p> 
<p>“I think the fact that Armagh picked up that point away to Kildare means that it’s more important for Clare to get the win than it is for Armagh. I think when they met last year, Armagh would have felt they had a good opportunity to win but this time there’s almost an expectation. This is probably the strongest Armagh squad that Kieran McGeeney has had to work with. Everyone he wants to have is there and I think they will feel they are on a pretty firm footing and that they really should be winning this game. In 2018, it wasn’t as clear-cut but this time around, Armagh have built up a really strong squad and I think the depth of the panel is now a cut above what we have had in recent years,” he noted.</p>
<p>Armagh, Donegal and Kildare are seen as the front-runners to battle it out for promotion to the top tier this season. Donegal and Kildare are only newly relegated from Division 1, while Armagh came up from Division 3. McConville admits that while promotion would be a huge bonus, the squad will be focused on making sure they hold onto their status, at the very least.</p>

           Whenever the word Clonbony is mentioned, the chances are Tom Malone will be too. 2018 marked a decade since the former president of Clare GAA passed away, after a lifetime dedicated to his beloved club. The legacy the great man left behind is as strong as ever and this Saturday night will see Clonbony Gaels from the last 50 years and beyond gather to reminisce on their time involved with the club.
           Founded in 1936, Clonbony has served as an outlet for the people of Miltown and its environs to participate in Gaelic games, along with being a social outlet too.
            Camogie, ladies football, the Clonbony pipe band and athletics club all fell under the club banner, as Tom developed his dream.
