<p>Playing with the aid of a strong breeze, Feakle-Killanena opened their account with two points from Regan Conway. Robyn Conway kept the score board ticking over with two more from play soon after.</p>
<p>With play turning to the other end Shauna Canny held strong between the posts to repeatedly deny Clooney-Quin a green flag but their perseverance was rewarded when they opened their account with a point in the 23rd minute from the stick of Deirdre Murphy.</p>
<p>Feakle-Killanena responded with a Claire McNamara point directly from the puck-out. Both sides exchanged points before Clooney Quin levelled matters when they raised their first green flag of the day, Murphy sending her shot to the back of the net. A point from Regan Conway saw Feakle-Killanena take a one point lead to the break on a scoreline of Feakle-Killanena 0-7 Clooney Quin 1-3.</p>
<p>Laura McGrath attacked the opposition straight from the throw-in and the ensuing free was converted by Regan Conway. McGrath herself was on target soon after and a well taken goal from Robyn Conway put four between the sides.</p>
<p>Clooney-Quin hit back immediately with a goal of their own, Sarah Costelloe striking to the back of the net. But this was quickly cancelled out when Robyn Conway was again on target with her second goal. </p>
<p>Four unanswered points from Clooney-Quin through Mairead Ryan, Ciara Grogan and Aoibheann Duggan saw this first round of the Division 2 League end in a draw.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, despite the wintery conditions, Whitegate and Bodyke got off to a flying start. Kilkishen-Bodyke were the first to put their names on the scoreboard with the opening point coming from Caoimhe Kelly following by an array of scores from Niamh O’Gorman, Siobhan Lenihan, Kate Lynch and a further point from Kelly. Despite being outplayed for the opening quarter of the game, Susan Fahy split the posts in the 29th minute of the game to put Whitegate on the score sheet. Kilkishen-Bodyke pushed on with two more points from Aoife Ryan and a further point from Alannah Ryan. Whitegate added a further point to their tally just before half-time with a great point from play from Greta Hickey to leave the half-time score Kilkishen-Bodyke 0-9 Whitegate 0-2. It finished 1-4 to 1-4</p>

          Clare Minor Camogie made it two wins from two with a comprehensive win over Offaly on Saturday afternoon in Fr McNamara Park. A nip and tuck first half saw just a point separate the sides at half-time. However, the second half was dominated by the home side, who ran out deserving winners.
