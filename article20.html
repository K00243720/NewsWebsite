          Division 3 spot secured
        </h1>

<p>Clare secured their spot in the Division 3 semi-finals on Sunday afternoon in determined fashion, with a solid performance over visitors Tyrone. Playing with the wind in the opening half, Clare held the visitors to a solitary point but were able to match their opponents’ scoring chances in the second half to run out convincing winners.</p>
<p>A strong opening quarter saw Clare strike for five points in as many minutes. Tyrone’s Amy Barrett may have hit for the game’s opening point inside the first minute but Niamh O’Gorman led the charge for Clare and opened their scoring with a point. Further points followed from Sinéad O’Keeffe, Regan Conway and another from O’Gorman.</p>
<p>Tyrone recovered from the initial onslaught and drove forward but Niamh Mulqueen won back possession to set up Louise McDonnell, who struck between the posts. Clare’s next two scores would certainly give supporters the opportunity to cheer, as the O’Gorman sisters both crashed home goals. Niamh struck first from an awkward angle, before Kate struck a rasper of a shot from 30 yards out to the corner of the net. Conway and McDonnell added a brace of points, while Kia Mellett set up Sinéad Power for Clare’s last point of the opening half to see Clare leading at half-time, 2-10 to 0-1.</p>
<p>With the wind at their back for the second half, supporters expected a backlash from Tyrone. However, Clare hadn’t read that part of the script and kept play at the Tyrone end. While no score was forthcoming for the Banner side, the element of surprise threw the Tyrone players. With that, Tyrone rang the changes. Goalkeeper Eimear Colton moved to midfield, as Leona Gallagher replaced her in goals with Laura Mason being the player to leave the field. This move did pay dividends for the visitors, with Colton winning the puck-out and feeding forward to Barrett, who struck between the posts.</p>
<p>From the puck-out, Kate O’Gorman won a free and landed her shot in the square, with Power getting the ball from the ensuing scramble and firing over. Clare were still on the attack and Niamh O’Gorman added a second goal to her tally with the next passage of play. With Tyrone winning a free in the middle, Colton sent her shot high, long and between the posts.</p>
<p>Tyrone won the battle of the puck-out and sent play forward, where Catherine Muldoon’s shot was blocked but Barrett got to the rebound to send her shot to the corner of the net. As the wind picked up, Clare won the puck-out and Corina McMahon fed play forward, with Alisha Malone gathering and striking between the posts.</p> 
<p>As heavy clouds darkened the skies over Meelick, Clare had one last attack left and driving forward, it was Conway who struck to the back of the net for Clare’s fourth goal just before referee John Horgan blew a well-timed final whistle, as the clouds overhead emptied onto the pitch, leaving Clare convincing winners 4-12 to 1-3.</p>
