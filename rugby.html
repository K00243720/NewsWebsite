        <h1>Ennis RFC Girls ready for shot at Munster League title</h1>
          <p class="article-info">
          By Derrick Lynch

<p class="article-content">
A huge weekend lies in store for Ennis Rugby Club, as the U-18 girls go in search of Munster glory. They make the trip to Irish Independent Park in Cork to face Carrick on Suir in the Munster Club League final. What makes it all the more remarkable is that it comes just a year after the girls section of Ennis RFC was revived.</p>
<p>Coach John Colleran says it has been a brilliant journey so far.
“We started last year with two teams, we fielded U16 and U18 sides and a got a huge response. We had no idea how popular and successful it was going to be. We had upwards of 80 girls who turned up to play. We started out playing friendlies for the first half of the year and then went on to play in the cup. We got drawn against a very strong Fethard team in the first round and they would have a number of girls on the Munster U-18 team at the time. That day was a real eye-opener for our girls in terms of the standard they should be aiming for. After losing that game, we went into the bowl competition and won that tournament which was a brilliant achievement for the squad. Our U16s also won the bowl, so suddenly we had a group of girls who had never played rugby when they came together at the start of the year, and now they were winning silverware,” he noted.</p>
<p>John is quick to point that there is a huge team of volunteers involved with the club. “The genesis of this came from Lorcan Hoyne and Alan Harvey. After that, it was all about gathering the manpower to keep the show on the road and I really don’t think they expected to get the massive response that they did in terms of players. The lads asked me to get involved then in the coaching side of it, and suddenly my daughter turned around to me and said that she wanted to start playing. A lot of the girls would have all been hearing about the boys playing rugby and winning titles so once the opportunity was afforded to them to do the same, they turned up in massive numbers” he said.</p>
<p>With increased playing numbers come increased demands on a club. “There are great people involved in Ennis Rugby Club across all the grades and codes. You have people who are still playing at adult level who have gotten involved in underage coaching, and even more then who are working behind the scenes. It’s very important to have people who co-ordinate the effort, and that’s where the likes of Lorcan and Alan come into it and take away all the admin side of things, it means we can just focus on the coaching and getting that side of it right.”</p>
<p>It’s already been a positive year for the group, as they came through the pool stages of the league after topping their group. Their only defeat came against local rivals Kilrush but the Ennis girls exacted revenge when they clashed in the return fixture. A big moment for the squad came in their semi-final tie though, when they were re-united with a Fethard outfit who had beaten them comprehensively in their maiden year. John feels that was a huge moment.</p>
<p>“Fethard finished second in their group which meant that we were at home for that semi-final, and that was a huge moment for us in the context of what had happened the previous year. That was a great boost for the girls and really showed that when they knuckle down, they are well capable of competing with the top teams. That set up our final with Carrick who were pushed all the way by Kilrush in the other semi-final. It’s really great for girls rugby in Clare to have two really strong teams competing in the province, and huge credit is due to George Nolan back in Kilrush for all the work they are doing.”</p> 
<p>Next up is that trip to Irish Independent Park on Saturday afternoon. “It’s a huge experience for them and it’s well deserved. I honestly believe that if they stick to their guns and stick to the way they are playing, they can do it,” he noted.
