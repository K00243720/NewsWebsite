          One-point win puts Crusheen-Tubber in final
        </h1>
          <p class="article-info">
          By Eoghan Moloney

          <div class="article-content">
<p>A late rally from the North Clare amalgamation, including five of the last six points, saw them through a tough battle in Newmarket-on-Fergus and booked their place in the U-21A final.</p>
<p>Crusheen-Tubber will now face Kilmaley this weekend for county title honours, having fought back from 0-13 to 0-10 down with 10 minutes remaining.</p>
<p>They had led for most of the first half, as St Joseph’s struggled to establish a foothold in the game and led 0-9 to 0-7 at the break before a Tom Hannan-inspired comeback saw the Parish storm into the lead in the second half..</p>
<p>It was Crusheen-Tubber who saw it out best, mostly through the steady nerve of centre-back Ross Hayes, who was on long-range frees.</p>
<p>Cian Barron and Diarmuid Mullins traded points early, before Hannan put over two frees for the Parish, while Aidan McNamara and Pádraig Kelly registered scores of their own for Crusheen-Tubber.</p>
<p>After this early exchange, Crusheen-Tubber took over, as their full and half-back lines were completely dominant and set up regular attacks for their side. Such was their dominance, St Joseph’s had only two scorers in the entire 68 minutes of hurling.</p> 
<p>Gavin O’Brien, in particular, was imperious at full-back, making spectacular catches and exemplifying all the traits of a trademark, rock-solid full-back.</p>
<p>At the other end of the field, McNamara, Kelly, from frees and play, and James Taaffe were doing the damage on the scoreboard. McNamara scored a gorgeous one-handed point after excellent soloing and a cute handpass from Cian Ketelaar set him free.</p>
<p>Taaffe’s point was also a beauty, as he pulled first time on a high ball, which just ricocheted over the crossbar, much to the relief of St Joseph’s. Late points in the half from Hannan and Cian Barron ensured St Joseph’s kept their opponents in sight, despite not firing in the first half. and they went in at half-time trailing by just two points, 0-9 to 0-7.</p>
<p>Kelly widened the gap to three with a free but after this, St Joseph’s came to life and got six scores without reply to take the game by the scruff of the neck. Hannan kick-started this by putting over a monster score from the right sideline on the 65’ and this lifted his team massively. St Joseph’s drove at Crusheen-Tubber and the amalgamation committed multiple fouls, allowing Hannan to punish them on the scoreboard with four consecutive frees.</p>
<p>Momentum swung once more, though, and Ross Hayes was to be the hero for his side as he slotted three consecutive long-range frees to level the game, before Joey Droney nosed his side ahead after a brilliant individual score on the 21’ on the right-hand sideline. Hayes then fired over one from play to give his side slight breathing room. Hannan added a free for the Parish to make sure added time would be nail-biting but as hard as St Joseph’s battled, they could not bridge the gap and Crusheen-Tubber saw it out gallantly.</p>

           Whenever the word Clonbony is mentioned, the chances are Tom Malone will be too. 2018 marked a decade since the former president of Clare GAA passed away, after a lifetime dedicated to his beloved club. The legacy the great man left behind is as strong as ever and this Saturday night will see Clonbony Gaels from the last 50 years and beyond gather to reminisce on their time involved with the club.
           Founded in 1936, Clonbony has served as an outlet for the people of Miltown and its environs to participate in Gaelic games, along with being a social outlet too.
            Camogie, ladies football, the Clonbony pipe band and athletics club all fell under the club banner, as Tom developed his dream.
