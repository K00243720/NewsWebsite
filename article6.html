          Guyler guides champions into semi-finals
        </h1>

<p>Inagh-Kilnamona were made to battle for their lives to stay in the hunt for a chance to regain the U-21 Hurling Championship by a tenacious Clonlara outfit last Sunday.</p>
<p>Micheál Stritch opened the scoring for Clonlara, as they settled into the unfavourable conditions the quicker, before Kealan Guyler and Tom Barry replied in kind for the North Clare side.</p>
<p>Darren Cullinan put Inagh-Kilnamona in front for the first time, before three points on the bounce from Clonlara’s Sean Begley, Cian Moriarty and Conor Burke nudged them back in front as half-time loomed but the North Clare side responded through Guyler once more and Eoin Fitzgerald to ensure it was all square at 0-5 each at half-time.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald also featured in the second half but for the wrong reason, as he was shown a second yellow and given his marching orders.</p>
<p>Barry had put Inagh-Kilnamona ahead, after Aidan Moriarty and Tom Power registered scores for Clonlara and when Guyler tagged on two more near the end, it appeared the reigning champs were going through but late points from Moriarty and Michael Clancy ensured extra time would be needed.</p>
<p>Moriarty, Galvin and Power all tacked on scores early in extra time for Clonlara, while the only score in the first period from the North Clare side came from Cian McInerney.</p> 
<p>The sides traded points before Eamonn Foudy in the Inagh-Kilnamona goal made a cracking save to deny Kieran Galvin, before Kealan Guyler put the game beyond doubt and ensured that his side would advance to the semi-finals against Kilmaley in what is sure to be a cracking encounter this Saturday.</p>

          Community at the heart of Clonbony

           Whenever the word Clonbony is mentioned, the chances are Tom Malone will be too. 2018 marked a decade since the former president of Clare GAA passed away, after a lifetime dedicated to his beloved club. The legacy the great man left behind is as strong as ever and this Saturday night will see Clonbony Gaels from the last 50 years and beyond gather to reminisce on their time involved with the club.
           Founded in 1936, Clonbony has served as an outlet for the people of Miltown and its environs to participate in Gaelic games, along with being a social outlet too.
            Camogie, ladies football, the Clonbony pipe band and athletics club all fell under the club banner, as Tom developed his dream.
