          Ryan relishes tough opener against Kerry
        </h1>
          <p class="article-info">
          By Derrick Lynch
        </p>  
          <div class="article-content">
<p>Clare get their 2019 National Ladies Division 2 Football League campaign underway this Sunday afternoon, when they host Kerry.</p>
<p>It’s a tough opener for James Murrihy’s side, who will be looking to improve on last year’s showing when they picked up just one win but managed to avoid relegation.</p>
<p>Banner Ladies’ Laurie Ryan captains Clare once more in 2019 and feels while it’s a tough opener, it’s a game they’re looking forward to.</p>
<p>“When you get back training, you’re always counting down to your first competitive match. We are really looking forward to this one now. We know we have a big challenge on our hands with Kerry and even though we have them at home, it’s going to be a huge task to start off with. These are the kind of games you would get excited about, though, so we can’t wait to get going,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s the first of a tough seven-game campaign for the Banner, with clashes against Armagh, Tyrone, Wexford, Waterford, Laois and Cavan to follow in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Kingdom are newly relegated from the top tier and are strongly fancied to bounce back at the first time of asking. Ryan says having them first up means that everyone will be ready from the word go.</p> 
<p>“You’re not going to find a much better team than Kerry to get the year underway. They were in the Munster final last year and won it the year before. We want to be challenging ourselves against the best teams and having the opportunity to play Kerry in the league will really stand to us later on in the year, when championship rolls around,” she noted.</p>
<p>She said, “We know plenty about each other over the last few years with UL, so I’d say he is sick of looking at me at this stage. It’s been brilliant to have him and to be able to make use of his knowledge of ladies football has been great. Martin McMahon brought us to another level last year, so it’s great that we have another coach of real quality coming in now with DJ. He’s really been building on what was achieved in 2018 to make sure that we are always on the front foot.</p>
<p>“Enda O’Halloran from Kilmihil has come in with us too and we still have the likes of Paul Dunne there with us since last year, which is great. It’s always nice to have an element of freshness and having those new voices to listen to will hopefully drive us on now for the year. All the girls in the squad would have a massive amount of respect for DJ after seeing what he achieved with UL and then on the inter-county scene with Mayo and Monaghan, so his credentials in the game really do speak for themselves.”</p>
<p>Clare struggled for form in the league in 2018 but the previous two campaigns had seen them reach the semi-final stage, along with an appearance in the All-Ireland intermediate championship final in Croke Park in 2016. The captain admits they are setting the bar high in terms of what they want to achieve this season.</p>
<p>“Maintaining our status in Division 2 has to be a minimum requirement for us this year, that’s definitely where we have to start. There’s some really quality sides in there with us, including a good number of senior teams, so it’s going to be a huge task to stay up there. The beauty of that is if you can manage to get a few early wins, then you can start looking up the table and hopefully get back to the semi-final stages, which would be great to look forward to."</p>

           Clare Minor Camogie made it two wins from two with a comprehensive win over Offaly on Saturday afternoon in Fr McNamara Park. A nip and tuck first half saw just a point separate the sides at half-time. However, the second half was dominated by the home side, who ran out deserving winners.
