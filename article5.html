          Division Two football very important for Clare
        </h1>
          <p class="article-info">

          <div class="article-content">
<p>Captain fantastic Gary Brennan stressed how important it is for Clare to be playing division two football after their last-gasp victory over Tipp secured their position in the second tier for 2020.
He stressed how hard his side had to dig and commended them for responding to the manager’s urgings at half-time.</p>
<p>“We got a fair roasting at half-time I wont lie, things were not good in there. But, the one thing I had said to the lads all week was to just keep playing until the 74th or 75th minute as that what it was going to take to get over the line. I knew this game was going to be back and forth, we had good spells, we had very poor spells. We had good spells and made bad mistakes, and had poor spells and did some brilliant things but fair play to the lads they kept working and we found a way to win in spite of the mistakes.</p>
<p>“At half-time we tried to correct a few things and came out and made a blistering start to the second half. We got into a good position but Tipp were never going to lie down and let us take Division Two status for next year, they were always going to fight back. Keelan in fairness found a brilliant goal at the end there and to take us level, and then it was a case of trying to push on and find a winner, and thankfully we found two,” Gary said.</p>
<p>While Clare were relieved to remain in the second half, Gary said this was far from their aim starting out in the season.</p>
<p>“It’s important to be playing at the highest level we can and we wanted to be at the upper end of the division but it didn’t pan out that way so it was very important to get the minimum out of the campaign and that was to stay in division two.</p> 
<p>“We got a very good press going at the start of the second half but they were always going to find a way out of it eventually and when they did they had the forwards to hurt you so it was no surprise at all that they came back into it. It was just about staying strong mentally until the end and making sure we were ahead,” Gary concluded.</p>

          Community at the heart of Clonbony

           Whenever the word Clonbony is mentioned, the chances are Tom Malone will be too. 2018 marked a decade since the former president of Clare GAA passed away, after a lifetime dedicated to his beloved club. The legacy the great man left behind is as strong as ever and this Saturday night will see Clonbony Gaels from the last 50 years and beyond gather to reminisce on their time involved with the club.
           Founded in 1936, Clonbony has served as an outlet for the people of Miltown and its environs to participate in Gaelic games, along with being a social outlet too.
            Camogie, ladies football, the Clonbony pipe band and athletics club all fell under the club banner, as Tom developed his dream.
