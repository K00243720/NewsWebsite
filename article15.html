          Two from two for minors

<p>Clare Minor Camogie made it two wins from two with a comprehensive win over Offaly on Saturday afternoon in Fr McNamara Park. A nip and tuck first half saw just a point separate the sides at half-time. However, the second half was dominated by the home side, who ran out deserving winners.</p>
<p>A Michelle Mescall free down the wing saw Lynda Daly gather and split the posts with less than two minutes played. From the puck-out, Clare won possession and sent the ball forward to Robyn Conway, who bore down on the Offaly danger area. A goalmouth scramble followed, with Offaly defending strongly but it was Chloe Neylon who got the last touch to send to the back of the net. A brace of Offaly frees from Amy Byrne and Becky Bryant followed to get the visitors off the mark.</p>
<p>Clare won their own puck-out and again play moved forward, with Conway being fouled in possession and Finia O’Brien converting the resulting free. This time, the puck-out was won by Jane Cleary and she sent it forward, where Emma Mulrooney gathered and sent it between the posts. Offaly had their purple patch over the next 10 minutes, when a Byrne free was neatly gathered by Bryant and the Tullamore youngster split the posts. Bryant landed her next free in the square and in the scramble it was tipped out over the line, which Bryant converted to level the sides.</p>
<p>Clare responded well, as Emily Cahill won the puck-out and fed forward to her Kilmaley club mate Neylon, who edged the home side back in front with a point. Cahill again won possession before picking out Lynda Daly, who added another point for the Banner. Jane Lowry pointed for the visitors and the last few minutes saw the sides exchange converted frees, O’Brien for the home side and Bryant for the visitors, to see the sides go in at the break with just a point separating them, Clare 1-5 Offaly 0-7.</p>
<p>If the first half was nip and tuck, the second half saw Clare dominate, with the aid of a strong wind at their backs. Caoimhe Kelly opened the scoring with a converted free and the puck-out returned to the square, before being tipped out for a 45’, which Kelly also converted. Lynda Daly and half-time substitute Greta Hickey both added from play, followed by another 45’ from Kelly to make it double scores in favour of the home side at Clare 1-11 Offaly 0-7.</p>
<p>Offaly had forays into the Clare danger area. However a tenacious Róisín Minogue saw the Bodyke youngster thwart the visitors on each attempt as she, Mescall and Susan Daly led a determined Clare defence. Ellen Regan eventually broke through in the 50th minute to add a point for Offaly.</p> 
<p>Clare responded by winning the Offaly puck-out and then a free, which Kelly duly converted. Aoibhín Ryan was next on the scoreboard for the Banner girls, when she pointed from out on the wing. Both Ryan and Lynda Daly were instrumental in Clare’s next goal, with the strike to the net finished by Neylon.</p>
<p>Play moved to the other end and though they won a free, Offaly also lost Kaitly Kennedy to a red card. Bryant converted the free for the final score of the game, leaving Clare comfortable winners on a full-time score of Clare 3-13 Offaly 0-9.</p>
