          Community at the heart of Clonbony
        </h1>
          <p class="article-info">
          By Derrick Lynch
        </p>  
          <div class="article-content">
<p>Whenever the word Clonbony is mentioned, the chances are Tom Malone will be too. 2018 marked a decade since the former president of Clare GAA passed away, after a lifetime dedicated to his beloved club. The legacy the great man left behind is as strong as ever and this Saturday night will see Clonbony Gaels from the last 50 years and beyond gather to reminisce on their time involved with the club.</p>
<p>Founded in 1936, Clonbony has served as an outlet for the people of Miltown and its environs to participate in Gaelic games, along with being a social outlet too. Camogie, ladies football, the Clonbony pipe band and athletics club all fell under the club banner, as Tom developed his dream. His son, Seán, is the current club secretary and one of the main organisers of Saturday night’s event.</p>
<p>“It’s something that was mooted for the last couple of months, as I was meeting former players and friends of the club, so we came up with the idea that it was high time we arrange a get-together. With the way things are in the modern way of living, we seldom get to meet. Pat O’Loughlin, who is our current chairman, and I got this idea of having a reunion of players and other club members who have been involved in the last 50 years and more. We are looking forward to Saturday night and getting together with old friends and colleagues that we haven’t seen for a while,” he explained.</p>
<p>Growing up in the Malone household meant there was no escaping the Clonbony influence but Seán is quick to point out that while Tom was the instigator, there were several others who rowed in behind the effort to keep the club going..</p>
<p>“The club was founded in 1936 and it was set up in a time when our area was a lot more populated than it is now. It was crying out for activities for young people to get involved in, so there was an opening there for developing things like running, football and hurling. The idea of hurling back here in West Clare at the time was almost an alien thought but it grew from there. The pipe band was set up then and the cycling and athletics club, so it all came together.</p>
<p>“Tom Malone had a lot to do with it but there lots of others down through the years who gave huge time and effort. If you were at any kind of gathering in the parishes of Miltown or Kilmurry and even up as far as Ennistymon, you were likely to meet someone who had either played with or been involved with Clonbony in some shape or form down the years,” said Seán.</p> 
<p>It wasn’t just developing hurling in West Clare that gave Tom Malone the reputation of being a pioneering figure in Clare GAA. The creation of a ladies football team for Clonbony was something that he took huge pride in but was also a venture that took a lot of people by surprise when Tom first announced his plans.</p>
<p>“I really think he went to his grave most satisfied with what was achieved with ladies football, in particular. I remember he told about the meeting where he first mentioned it and there were only a handful of ladies football clubs in the whole country at the time. Not to reflect poorly on the male population of the GAA at the time but he was laughed out of the meeting, but look at it now. Ladies football has made huge progression in recent times and shown the men what to do in a lot of ways also,” said Seán.</p>

          St Anne's in search of Munster glory
        </h2>
          <p class="article-info">

        <p class="article-content">
           It is a busy time for the students of St Anne’s Community College in Killaloe. Mock exams start this week as the big build up to June gathers pace, and there’s the small matter of a Munster Colleges Hurling final to be dealt with too.
            If second-level schools are the mould in which the character of future generations are formed, then the students in Killaloe are in safe hands. Not only are they juggling academic and sporting commitments, but for four of them, a trip to Missionvale in South Africa to volunteer their time and services is also on the horizon. Two of the those students, Dylan McMahon and James Power, are due to fly out on Saturday February 16th, which was the original date of their Munster Colleges Final against Borrisokane. After some negotiations between the two schools, it was agreed to bring the game forward by a week that both players wouldn’t have to miss out on one of their biggest days yet in their sporting lives. </p>
